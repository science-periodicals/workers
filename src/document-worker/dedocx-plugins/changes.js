/**
 * By default, `dedocx`] represents DOCX change tracking by
 * including all insertions in `ins` elements and all deletions in `del` elements. A lot of the time,
 * one does not wish to keep the full markup, but simply to either accept or reject the changes.
 *
 *  This plugin takes a simple configuration.
 *  It is instantiated using `require('dedocx-plugin-changes')({ â€¦ })`.
 *
 *   - `mode`, can be `accept` (the default) or `reject`. The `accept` mode is to accept the changes,
 *   which means keeping the insertions and removing the deletions from the document. The `reject`
 *   mode is the reverse: insertions are removed from the document, while deletions are maintained.
 *   - `keepMarkup`, boolean defaulting to `false`. If set to `true`, the `ins` and `del` that are not
 *   removed will be kept as such. Note that while in `accept` mode it is possibly sensible for `ins`
 *   to be in the content, in `reject` mode it is somewhat strange to keep the `del` around since after
 *   rejection that content is technically not deleted. If set to `false` the remaining `ins` and `del`
 *   elements will either be replaced with a `span` if they have some attributes, or directly with
 *   their content otherwise.
 *   - `killComments`, boolean defaulting to `true`. When `true`, indications of the range of comments
 *   and position of comment references are wiped, when `false` they're kept.
